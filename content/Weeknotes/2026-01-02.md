Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 2nd January 2026.

After another hiatus, weeknotes are back.
A lot has happened in the last six months.
Nevertheless, these are *weeknotes*.
What happened *this week*?

I've been reading about
prescribing data, BNF codes, and dm+d codes
in preparation for starting work on [OpenPrescribing][] next week.
We have a new team, [a new codebase][1], a new GitHub project, and a new Slack channel.

I asked my colleagues what I should read to get up to speed and they suggested:

* [Limitations of NHS England prescribing data][3]
* [Prescribing data: BNF codes][2]
* [What is the dm+d? The NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices][4]

These took me to many, many pages on various NHS websites.
The page I bookmarked, however, was [English Prescribing Dataset (EPD) with SNOMED Code][5].

What have I learnt?
Well,
that an *[indication][]* is a symptom that suggests that particular medical treatment is necessary.
That prescribing data represent reimbursement claims from dispensing contractors;
prescriptions issued and prescriptions dispensed are separate, but related.
That BNF codes once formed a hierarchy; now they don't, unless you're the NHSBSA.
That a thing called ePACT2 gives authorised users access to prescribing data.
That ePACT2 relates to a thing called the One Drug Database.
That the dm+d contains an alphabet spaghetti of terms: VTM, VMP, VMPP, AMP, AMPP.
And that [my colleagues were helping the NHS identify cost savings over eight years ago][6].
Considerable cost savings:
a theoretical maximum of £410 million over 12 months.

Time's up!
