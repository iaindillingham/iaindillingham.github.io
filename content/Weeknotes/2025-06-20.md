Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 20th June 2025.

I've been reading about [continuous integration][] (CI) and [continuous delivery][] (CD),
and trying to imagine software development without pull requests (PRs).
Although Ben B.C. has talked about this before,
my prompt was returning to a PR with unresolved comments.
It took me a non-trivial amount of time to remember the context
and I'm sure it was no different for Alice,
who opened the PR.

The aspect of CI/CD I don't yet understand is how to break a feature into a logical sequence of commits,
*without first completing the feature*.
I'm used to creating the sequence by selectively staging and committing,
and to rearranging the sequence by rebasing before merging.
I'm not used to merging a part-created sequence;
that is, to merging what Martin Fowler calls *latent code*.

Time's up!
