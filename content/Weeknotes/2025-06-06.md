Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 6th June 2025.

Paternity leave!
More specifically, *additional* paternity leave!

[The University of Oxford Additional Paternity/Partner Leave][1] scheme means I have 10 additional weeks of paternity leave.
Needless to say, the scheme is amazing.

[Last week](<{filename}/Weeknotes/2025-05-30.md>)
I started thinking about pair programming as an alternative to pull requests.
This week I read "[Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches][]" by Martin Fowler.
I'd like to learn more about continuous delivery
and "Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches" gave useful and interesting context.

Time's up!
