Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 23rd May 2025.

Katie showed me [a code snippet][1] within which I noticed the following idiom:

```py
del a_list[:]
```

I was sure that `[:]` copied the list,
but I wasn't sure what `del` did to it.
Deleted a copy of the list?
Deleted the contents of a copy of the list?
What happened to the list?

After experimenting in the Python shell,
I realised that `del` and `[:]` deleted the contents of the list.
In other words, they're equivalent to the following:

```py
a_list.clear()
```

I find the use of `del` and `[:]` confusing.
If you slice a list, then you get a new list.
But if you delete a slice of a list,
then you don't:
the elements contained by the slice are deleted from the list.

When we describe code as "idiomatic",
we mean "a characteristic mode of expression" (Oxford Languages).
In this case, however,
I mean "a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of individual words" (Oxford Languages).

This week,
I also finished writing a proposal for a feature that will touch several of our systems and processes;
talked about the future of the OpenPathology project;
and helped Alice update [the case-control studies documentation][2].
