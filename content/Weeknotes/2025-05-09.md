Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 9th May 2025.

After a hiatus, weeknotes are (hopefully) back.
In the last six months, I've become a dad, taken a month off, and become a tech lead.
Nevertheless, these are *weeknotes*.
What happened *this week*?

Several things happened this week,
but I only have time to write about one:
I was frustrated by an idea that I keep hearing at work.
Namely, that you need a copy of production data for local development.
Or, if you're not using a copy of production data when you're doing local development,
then you're not doing local development right.

Certainly, it's handy to tinker with a copy of production data;
you can tailor a user interface to fit a long string
or to fit domain-specific words and expressions ("jargon").
Having a copy of production data also makes replicating bugs easier.
However, production data can be large.
They can also contain [personal data][1],
which must be removed before a copy is made.
And once the personal data are removed,
the copy is no longer a copy of production data.

Time's up!
