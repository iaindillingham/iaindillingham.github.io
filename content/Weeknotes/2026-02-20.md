Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 20th February 2026.

We started our second three-week cycle on OpenPrescribing v2 this week.
We're focusing on "more effective visualisations".
However, I spent much of this week fixing, or trying to fix, OpenPrescribing v1.
Its VM frequently runs out of CPU and memory,
and heavy traffic probably isn't the cause.

This week,
I also read a post about [host leadership][1] by Martin Fowler.
It reassured me that my misgivings about servant leadership weren't misplaced.
