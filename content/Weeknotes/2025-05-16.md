Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 16th May 2025.


Annual leave!

For several reasons I found myself going to bed and waking up early.
I started reading about [Rust][] (it's a programming language, dad)
and working through the [Getting Started][] section of [The Book][].
I was impressed by the quality of the documentation
and the friendliness of the community.
I should make time to learn Rust properly.
