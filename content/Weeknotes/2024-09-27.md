Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 27th September 2024.

This was my third full week as Katie's buddy.
We covered:

* [When `QuerySet`s are evaluated](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/querysets/#when-querysets-are-evaluated)
* The nature of the SQL statements generated by Django's ORM
* List comprehensions (listcomps)
* Breakpoints, [the Python debugger](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pdb.html#module-pdb), and [pdb++](https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp)
* [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/)
* Django's requests, responses, and middleware (within the context of views and authentication)
* Callables (within the context of a URLconf)
* And [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)

Katie also started MDN's [Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).

There were many great learning moments with Katie this week.
The best?
On Monday, I watched Katie find out that `MyModel.objects.count()` caches the result.
On Friday, I heard Katie ask
"Why does this view take less time to render, when I refresh the page?"
and immediately answer "Ah, because the results are cached!"

Besides buddying,
I was on tech support this week.
It was great to be busy again, after several months of quiet.
I revisited how we restrict access to datasets,
and had a couple of productive conversations with Lucy and Ben B.C.

Finally, Simon reminded me of "[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/)".
I'm really enjoying it.
If nothing else, then it's helping me understand why I have an aversion to SPAs.
