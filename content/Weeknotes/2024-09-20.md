Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 20th September 2024.

This was my second full week as Katie's buddy.
We covered:

* the Django shell (`manage.py shell`)
* the database shell (`manage.py dbshell`)
* displaying two shells in one window with [Terminator](https://gnome-terminator.org/)
* creating and saving models with managers and instances
* environment variables and their use in the [twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/)
* file permissions

I gave an hour-long talk on "Writing and running study code",
a 10 minute talk on job-server,
and another 10 minute talk on the OpenSAFELY command-line interface.

I revisited how the OpenSAFELY platform restricts datasets,
tracing a line from the OpenSAFELY command-line interface to GitHub issues,
via research-template and research-action.
I'm hoping to discuss how the OpenSAFELY platform restricts datasets in next week's "Cabinet of Curiosities".
