Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 30th January 2026.

This week, I:

* realised that I'd started, and not finished, half a dozen books on tech leadership/management
* read a lovely blog post from Will Larson about [including engineers in leadership meetings][2]
* realised that the [Eisenhower Matrix][] works well for people, but not so well for teams
* read a lovely blog post from Julia Evans about [learning an Old Boring Technology][1]
* felt as though I couldn't keep up with the management *and* engineering sides of being a tech lead
* felt as though I didn't know what a tech lead was, anyway

## Tech leadership/management books

Although I've been a tech lead for over a year,
most days feel like my first day.
I don't feel I'm bad at the job; but I don't feel I'm good at the job either.
My tried-and-tested approach to getting better at something is to read a book about it.
So, over the last year I've started half a dozen books on tech leadership/management.
In alphabetical order by title, they are:

* [Debugging Teams][], by Ben Collins-Sussman and Brian Fitzpatrick
* [Engineering Management for the Rest of Us][], by Sarah Drasner
* [Leading Effective Engineering Teams], by Addy Osmani
* [Scaling People][], by Claire Hughes Johnson
* [Smart Management][], by Jochen Reb, Shenghua Luan, and Gerd Gigerenzer
* [Team Topologies][] by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais
* [The Manager's Path][], by Camille Fournier

Alas, I've not finished them.
I don't wish to criticise these books:
they're well written,[^1] well produced, and draw on the authors' experience.
However, after several hours in each other's company, the book and I drift apart.

Why?

* I don't want a book-length treatment of tech leadership/management.
  I want something like [untools][] ("Tools for better thinking").
* I want something that's well written and thoughtful.
  I have [Thinking of Answers][], by A.C. Grayling in mind.
  Good blog posts can be both, but tend toward first-cuts.
* I want something that isn't over-fitted to the authors' experience.
  Whilst there are valuable lessons from Google and Stripe,
  I work for neither Google nor Stripe.
  My current team has three software developers; my last team, two.
  One of those software developers is/was me.

Alas, I don't have time to write more.
But something is better than nothing.

  Okay, *mostly* well written.
