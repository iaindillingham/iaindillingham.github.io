Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 13 June 2025.

As [last week]({filename}/Weeknotes/2025-06-06.md),
additional paternity leave!

This week I learnt about [`git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date`][1].
Normally after a rebase,
the author date is that of the original commit
but the commit date is that of the new commit.
With this option,
the author date and the commit date are that of the original commit.

I've been using this option to tidy up rebases,
such that the topological order of a set of commits is also the temporal order,
both by author date and commit date.
Honestly, I don't think a different temporal order matters that much
but [as I've said before]({filename}/Weeknotes/2025-05-30.md),
[blub studies][2] are important!

Time's up!
