Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 23 January 2026.

My weeknotes for this week are shorter than usual.
I try to start writing them on Tuesday or Wednesday,
but it's Friday afternoon and I'm just starting.

This week, I:

* was an incident coordinator
* learned even more about BNF codes
* helped establish some norms about code reviews
* wondered where my week had gone

## Incident coordinator

When a software developer notices that there's something wrong with one of our systems,
they declare an incident in a dedicated Slack channel.
Other software developers then help to resolve the incident.
To keep them focused,
the incident coordinator communicates with everyone who isn't helping to resolve the incident:
mostly users, but also other software developers.

This week, Katie noticed that there was something wrong with [OpenSafely Jobs][].
She declared an incident and, after a short while, resolved it.
I was the incident coordinator.
So far, so unremarkable.
But that's the point:
It takes time and effort to make things unremarkable.
