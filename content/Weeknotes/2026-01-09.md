Title: Weeknotes

Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 9 January 2026.

This week, I was occupied by setting up the new team.
We're working on [OpenPrescribing][],
but as there's already a group of people who are associated with OpenPrescribing,[^1]
and as that group of people refer to themselves as a team,
calling the new team "the OpenPrescribing team" could be confusing.

A couple of candidates were
"the OpenPrescribing delivery team" and "the OpenPrescribing development team".
Alas, *delivery* means different things to different people:
people outside the new team will almost certainly be delivering OpenPrescribing in some way
and it would be unfair to suggest that our work delivered whereas their work didn't.
Neither candidate is consistent with the names of the other other tech group teams:
the Researcher Experience team, or REX;
the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline team, or RAP;
and the Research Software Innovation team, or RSI.
*Consistent* is hardly well-defined:
"about the thing, not the people" and "sounds like the name of a dinosaur, mostly"
are probably what we mean by *consistent*.

I asked my colleagues for their views and
"sounds like the name of a dinosaur, mostly" was as close to the consensus view as I could find.
There aren't any dinosaurs with "prescribing" or "rx", meaning *prescription*,
in their names, so we invented the *Prescribosaurus*.
After some prompting by Thomas, an LLM generated the new team's mascot.

Welcome, Team Prescribosaurus!

What else happened this week?

* I've been reading [the new codebase][1].
* I had a lengthy discussion about supporting claims with evidence.
* I had a lengthy discussion about Architectural Decision Records.
* I learned about what front-end development looks like in 2026.
* Peter and I discussed what Team Prescribosaurus might [bet][2] on next week.

  Jess suggested calling that group of people "the OpenPrescribing network".
  I like the name, but it would take a lot of effort to socialise.
