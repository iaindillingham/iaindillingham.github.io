Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 8th November 2024.

I wrote these on Monday, 11th November.
I struggled to remember the previous week!

The REX (Researcher EXperience) team started a new initiative:
"Onboarding OpenCodelists".
Lucy and Mary asked us to split into two squads.
One squad will focus on maintaining OpenCodelists;
the other squad will focus on discovery.

From my perspective,
maintaining OpenCodelists is important;
discovery, less so.
It's not clear to me what happens after discovery,
because the initiative doesn't seem to allocate any time for developing new features.
Lucy also said that she wasn't clear whether the REX team would be responsible for OpenCodelists for much longer.
