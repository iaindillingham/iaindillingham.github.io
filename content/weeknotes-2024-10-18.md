Weeknotes for the week finishing Friday, 18th October 2024.

I'm back after a two-week hiatus.

Katie and I have reduced the frequency of our meetings,
which I think has helped each of us focus on our other tasks.
We're now meeting on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings for a "short" hour
and Monday to Friday afternoons for a "short" half hour.

We covered:

* Types of test (MDN's [Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Testing) lists 16!)
* Variable scope
* Closures
* [Nerd sniping](https://xkcd.com/356/)

We also took a [code walk](https://youtu.be/5VZrCnKLmP8) through job-server.
Katie and I reviewed an excellent pull request from Mike,
and Katie reviewed a small (also excellent) pull request (also from Mike) on her own.

Besides buddying,
I was on tech support.
Like last time, it was great to be busy again.
Lucy was away, so I took over her non-line management tasks.
With buddying, tech support, and non-line management tasks,
there wasn't much time left.
