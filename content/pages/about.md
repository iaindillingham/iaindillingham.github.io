Title: About

Hello, I'm Iain.
I'm a tech lead
at the [Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science][] at the University of Oxford.

I speak Python, SQL,
and a couple of more exotic languages: [Vega][] and [Vega-Lite][].

I've worked in tech for over 10 years.
During this time, I've been:

* **a senior software engineer**,
  also at the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science,
  where I helped build [OpenSAFELY][].
* **a data visualisation engineer** at [Polecat][],
  where I helped develop visual, interactive interfaces to data.
* **a data engineer** at [Verisk Maplecroft][],
  where I helped build ETL pipelines with Apache Airflow.
* **a software engineer**,
  also at Verisk Maplecroft,
  where I helped build content management systems with Django and Wagtail.

Before working in tech,
I was a research fellow in GeoInformatics at the [University of St Andrews][],
and completed a PhD and MSc in Geographic Information Science at the [giCentre][],
[City St George's, University of London][].
[My research]({filename}/pages/publications.md) focused on designing, developing, and evaluating visual, interactive interfaces to data.
This is known as [infovis][], [geovis][], or [visual analytics][] inside academia;
datavis, outside.[^1]

  Respectively,
  information visualisation, geographic (information) visualisation, and data visualisation.
