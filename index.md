## Hello there!

I'm a versatile visualisation, data, and software engineer.
I enjoy using computers to answer questions.

I have an MSc and PhD in Geographic Information Science from [City, University of London][],
where I was lucky enough to be part of the [giCentre][].
After graduating, I spent a year as a research fellow in GeoInformatics at the [University of St Andrews][].
I then spent four years with [Verisk Maplecroft][] as a software and data engineer,
and 2.5 years with [Polecat][] as a data visualisation engineer.
Since March 2021,
I have been a software developer at the [Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science][] at the University of Oxford,
working on [OpenSAFELY][].
